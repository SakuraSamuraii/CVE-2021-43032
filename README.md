# CVE-2021-43032
In XenForo â‰¤ 2.2.7, a threat actor with access to the admin panel can save cross-site scripting payloads in any function within the application that accepts HTML code. A payload placed within the 'Advertising' functionality will execute globally on the client side, allowing for multiple exploitation scenarios, whereas other payloads will execute on the clientside depending on where it was stored.

# Impact
The biggest risk with this vulnerability would be an ill-intended user executing covert actions embeded in extensive HTML pages, such as mining cryptocurrency or exfiltrating data. This could be a user with pre-existing access to the application, or a threat actor that obtains credentials via account takeover or social engineering methodology.
